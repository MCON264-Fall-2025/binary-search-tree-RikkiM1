1. Why does inorder traversal of a BST return elements in sorted order?
because we are going through the tree from root to left to right so we are "collecting" all the noeds in their correct
order because that is how they are sorted when out into the tree. so we are getting them back in the right order.

2. Give an example of an insertion order that produces a highly unbalanced BST.
What does the inorder traversal look like for that tree?

when every new element is inserted to the same side.
would give the correct order.

3. In your own words, explain the differences between:

Recursive vs iterative traversal
recursive cannot handle a very deep tree and does not need to keep track of its own data while stack is not as easy and need
to keep track of your own data.

Depth-first vs breadth-first traversal
going all the way down one way and then all the way down the other side vs going side to side and slowly making your way down.

4. When might you prefer a breadth-first traversal in a real application?
if you just want to get the "lowest" oder, like the one that is the highest in ascending order ,
